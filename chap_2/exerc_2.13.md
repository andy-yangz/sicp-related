Assume both interval x y are positive, then as exerc_2.11 show, than the result interval is [x1y1, x2y2]  
And if we write x1 x2 y1 y2 in center and perc form.  
assume px is x's percentage, and py y.  
cx is x's center, cy y.

Therefore
$$
x_1=c_x(1-p_x)\\
x_2=c_x(1+p_x)\\
y_1=c_y(1-p_y)\\
y_2=c_y(1+p_y)
$$
And use the result interval formula
$$
[c_1c_2(1-p_1-p_2+p_1p_2), c_1c_2(1+p_1+p_2+p_1p_2)] \\
c1c2[(1-p_1-p_2+p_1p_2), (1+p_1+p_2+p_1p_2)]
$$
So we can approx the new center is $c_1c_2$.  
Therefore the new tolerence(percentage) is
$$
(1+p_1+p_2+p_1p_2)-(1-p_1-p_2+p_1p_2) = 2(p1+p2) \\
p1+p2
$$
